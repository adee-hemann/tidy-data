# tidy-data
## Tidy data assignment
Data is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis.R script is used to combine data from mutiple files based on a set criteria, clean up the data (descriptive labels, etc.) and create a new tidy data text file.

The code can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.

A code book is available as well, CodeBook.md
